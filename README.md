HI THIS MY WEDSITE CREATED BY VENKATARAO

my name "kota venkatarao" 
 my dream is "Software Developer"
 the creative minds behind software programs, and they have the technical skills to build those programs or to oversee their creation by a team. They create software that enables users to perform specific tasks on computer devices.

Developers can work in systems software or in applications such as those for mobile devices, but their duties are similar in many cases.
